Scripts for mirroring an SVN repository in git.

The basic git-svn commands are OK for creating a local copy of an SVN
repository, but it's not obvious how the normal --mirror behavior can be
replicated.

These scripts use git svn clone to create a vanilla git copy of an svn
repository, then create local branches/tags which mirror those in the
original svn repo.  A second script automates the process of fetching
the svn changes (to remote tracking branches) and rebasing them onto
the local branches/local tags.

In this manner, the git mirror can be cloned, and the clones will
show the tags/branches of the svn repo as one would expect.  Without
these extra steps, only the default head (master) of the original git
repo would show up.
